              COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a viral infectious disease caused by 
              SARS-CoV-2 and is currently a World Health OrganizatiÎ¿n (WHO) declared pandemic. 
              As of October 2021, over 200 million people had been infected globally with over 
              4.5 million deaths 13.

              Clinical presentation
              Many people with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic 9. Symptoms and signs of COVID-19 are non-specific 1 but in symptomatic individuals most commonly include:

              fever (85-90%)
              cough (65-70%) with sputum (30-35%)
              smell and taste disturbances (50%) 12
              fatigue (35-40%)
              shortness of breath (15-20%)
              Complications
              The likelihood of severe illness requiring hospitalisation correlates closely with male sex, advanced age and presence of comorbidities.

              ~5% admitted patients require ICU admission
              Multiple serious sequelae have been reported including:

              acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
              coagulopathy: including PE and DIC
              secondary infections, e.g. bacterial pneumonia
              myocardial injury
              sepsis
              acute kidney injury (AKI)
              multiorgan failure
              secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
              Pathology
              SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus, one of the genera of the Coronaviridae family of viruses. SARS-CoV-2 is indirectly zoonotic, but transmission is now primarily interhuman. The closest animal coronavirus by genetic sequence is a bat coronavirus 5. The cause of death is usually respiratory failure secondary to massive alveolar injury.

              Radiographic features
              The primary findings of COVID-19 are those of an atypical or organising pneumonia 2,3. Up to 18% of cases demonstrate normal chest x-rays or CT when mild/early in the disease course 10. Bilateral and/or multilobar involvement is common, more often with a lower zone distribution.

              Plain radiograph
              patchy or diffuse airspace opacities, whether consolidation or ground-glass opacity 10,11
              pleural effusion is rare</p> */}
